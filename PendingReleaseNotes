v0.90
-----

* Previously, the formatted output of 'ceph pg stat -f ...' was a full
  pg dump that included all metadata about all PGs in the system.  It
  is now a concise summary of high-level PG stats, just like the
  unformatted 'ceph pg stat' command.




* All JSON dumps of floating point values were incorrecting surrounding the
  value with quotes.  These quotes have been removed.  Any consumer of structured
  JSON output that was consuming the floating point values was previously having
  to interpret the quoted string and will most likely need to be fixed to take
  the unquoted number.

* The 'category' field for objects has been removed.  This was originally added
  to track PG stat summations over different categories of objects for use by
  radosgw.  It is no longer has any known users and is prone to abuse because it
  can lead to a pg_stat_t structure that is unbounded.  The librados API calls
  that accept this field now ignore it, and the OSD no longers tracks the
  per-category summations.

* The output for 'rados df' has changed.  The 'category' level has been
  eliminated, so there is now a single stat object per pool.  The structure of
  the JSON output is different, and the plaintext output has one less column.

* The 'rados create <objectname> [category]' optional category argument is no
  longer supported or recognized.
